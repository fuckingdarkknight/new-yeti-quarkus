### Environment

JAVA_HOME need to be set correctly, the PATH also.

Under Windows :
JAVA_HOME=c:\dev\jdk8
PATH=%JAVA_HOME%\bin;%PATH%

Under Linux :
export JAVA_HOME=/dev/jdk8
export PATH=$JAVA_HOME/bin:$PATH

OpenJDK 8 or Oracle JDK8 is your choice.

### Launching

Just execute launch.bat or launch.sh depending on your OS

On Linux : chmod u+x launch.sh to make the shell executable for the concerned linux user.
